# Youtube Backend
This is sort of a youtube backend created in Nodejs. To store the videos and images I used cloudinary and for 
database I used NoSql database MongoDb

## How to setup: 
Make sure you have Nodejs installed

Step 1: Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Piyushhpatel/yt-backend.git
```

Step 2: Go to Repository and install node modules
```
cd yt-backend
npm install
```

Step 3: Now Create a .env file and paste the content of .env.sample file and add the details. you need to add your own secrets and api keys

Step 4: Start the server
```
npm run dev
```

Now your server is up and running I feel like I might have forgotten somehthing LOL, but now it's up to you to solve the bugs 
Once server is running use post or curl to test then routes now what are the routes now am too lazy to tell use go to route find out yourself

Happy Coding >_<
